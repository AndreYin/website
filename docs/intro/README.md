# Introduction

## What is `ElectronForConstruct`

`ElectronForConstruct` (**E4C**) is a set of tools to help you develop your game using the [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) framework instead of [NW.js](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/) (that is provided by default with any Construct version) \
It appears that Electron itself, while doing the same job as NW.js, do it better, faster and safer. \
[Here is a reference comparing Electron and NW.js](https://github.com/ElectronForConstruct/template/blob/develop/electron-advantages.md)

## How it works

The first part  is just a template of a minimal Electron app that works with Construct 2 and 3. \
The second part is a cli-powered app to easily manage, preview or build your projects and more!

## Why ?
For fun. \
I saw too many people complaining about slow updates, small amount of features or bugs with NW.js. I love Electron, so I took the opportunity to help people
