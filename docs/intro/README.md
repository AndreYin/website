# Introduction

## What is `ElectronForConstruct`

`ElectronForConstruct` (efc) is a command-line tool to help you develop your game using the [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) framework instead of [NW.js](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/) (that is provided by default with any Construct version) \
It appears that Electron itself, while doing the same job as NW.js, do it better, faster and safer. \
[Here is a reference comparing Electron and NW.js](https://github.com/ElectronForConstruct/template/blob/develop/electron-advantages.md)

## How does it works ?

Under the hood, efc use a predefined template of a minimal Electron app that works with Construct 2 and 3. \
The cli, just use your electron project and use it with the template according to your configuration allowing you to easily manage, preview or build your projects and more!

## Why ?
For fun. \
I saw too many people complaining about slow updates, small amount of features or bugs with NW.js. I love Electron, so I took the opportunity to help people.\
An other reason I chosed to make this is that Construct 3 doesn't give you the ability to preview your game using using NW.js. With efc you can preview your game from C3 within Electron.
