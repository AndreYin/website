# Using the module

The module is extremely easy to use:
- It's interactive
- No complex flags to pass to the cli
- Adapt to its environment
- **Cross-Platform**
 
All the following demonstrations will be made using cmder on Windows 10

## Creating the project
After the installation of the module using the `npm` command, it was registered a new command inside your terminal: `e4c` \
Try now by yourself:
- Create an empty directory
- Open a console and navigate to your freshly created directory
- Type `e4c` and watch the magic happening

If the module does not detect the current folder as a project, it prompt you to create one

![Generate a new Project](/)

Once you have one and you're located in it, you need to install `node_modules`.

If not already done manually, the module will help you:
![Install depts](/)

After you folder is fully ready, the module will start showing its features:

![Full options availabe](/)
<!-- 
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="/full_options_available" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
-->

You're ready, you project is setup. You can now go on to the next section where we'll look into how to preview your game using you favorite engine.
